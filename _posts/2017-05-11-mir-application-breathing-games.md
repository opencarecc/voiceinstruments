<blockquote><i>A planet where everyone breathes freely.</i></blockquote>

On August 2016, Breathing Games took part to the <b>Open & Change Care</b> application to <b>MacArthur's Foundation</b>. On 11th of May 2017 we submitted our application to the <b>CALL FOR MAKERS - opencare Maker In Residence.</b>

The <b>opencare Maker in Residence</b> is the first edition of a special residency program organized by [WeMake](wemake.cc), as part of the <b>opencare</b> European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.

We applied as [Breathing Games](www.breathinggames.net) which promotes respiratory health by encouraging each citizen to take care of their health. We create <b>educational and therapeutic games</b>, devices to measure the breathe and distributed data systems to inform public health practices and policies.

We create a commons – collectively managed <b>resources</b> that are <b>freely accessible</b> and can be used and enriched by everyone – by spurring collaboration between people affected, caregivers, and passionate professionals to build on the collective intelligence.
