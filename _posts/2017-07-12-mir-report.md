Our two-week <b>opencare</b> residence at <b>WeMake</b> Milano was a success!

We were able to do a <b>review of literature</b>, develop a <b>modulable kit</b> to test different pressure and flow sensors, build a pump to calibrate the sensors, and enhance our website.

Watch the final presentation of the MIR to get all details!

The articles gathered, electronics designs, 3d models, and other elements can be found in our repository and on GitLab. The work is released under a [Peer production license](http://wiki.p2pfoundation.net/Peer_Production_License).

In the next weeks, we are going to finalize the research protocol to test the sensors in <b>Canadian hospitals</b>, and write a scientific article to share the key learnings of the residence. We will present these outcomes during the <b>[OpenVillage Festival](https://edgeryders.eu/c/festival)</b> in Brussels.

Keep posted, follow us!
