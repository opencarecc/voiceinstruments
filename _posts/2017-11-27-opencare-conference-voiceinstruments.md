On November 22nd and 23rd I have participated to <b>[opencare conference](http://opencare.cc/conference/)</b>, since I have been selected, together with other 9 projects, for the <b>[Call for Solutions](http://wemake.cc/2017/08/31/partecipa-alla-call-for-solution-entro-il-30-settembre/)</b>.

The <b>opencare conference</b> represents the conclusion of the European project <b>opencare</b>, and is an opportunity to discuss together with the local and international communities involved, with researchers interested in the topic, with international experts and with Policy Makers, and find an answer to the following questions:
* What are the <b>new models for care</b> in the community and how are they supported by digital technologies?
* What conditions (urban, organizational) can <b>facilitate the spread</b> of "open" and collaborative care systems?
* What is the role of the <b>new digital manufacturing actors</b> in the processes of social innovation and care?

The Call for Solutions, on the other hand, aims to <b>gather innovative ideas</b> in the field of new technologies, apps, equipment, entrepreneurial ideas, products and digital platforms that promote care solutions for communities, families, caregivers and single individuals.

Even though I didn't win the prize, I think this experience has been extremely useful to kickstart the project Voice Instruments and get feedback from the public and people interested in the topic.
