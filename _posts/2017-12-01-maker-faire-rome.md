From December 1st to 3rd I've participated to <b>[Maker Faire Rome](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/en/)</b> with the project [Voice Instruments](http://www.makerfairerome.eu/it/mappa/) in the category Wellness & Healthcare, and I won the prize <b>Maker of Merit</b>!

Voice Instruments is <b>quickly improving</b>, thanks to all these experiences that I've been involved into and to the interest of the community.
More news to come, stay updated!
