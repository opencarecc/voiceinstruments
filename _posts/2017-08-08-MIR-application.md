On August 8th 2017 I’ve submitted the application to the <b><a href='http://wemake.cc/opencare/maker-in-residence-en/' target='_blank'>CALL FOR MAKERS - opencare Maker In Residence</a></b>.
<br><br>
The opencare Maker in Residence is the first edition of a special residency program organized by WeMake, as part of the <a href='https://opencare.cc' target='_blank'>opencare</a> European project. It provides support, assistance, funding and acceleration to Makers – from all over the world – who are interested in developing / validating / iterating an open source project in the health and care field.
<br><br>
My project name is <b>Voice Instruments<b/>, composed by voice display modules that allow people with disabilities, blind or unable to read, to learn a value that usually has to be read.
